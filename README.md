Package to send text messages from a google voice account.

The basis for this package is https://code.google.com/p/pygooglevoice/ and 
https://code.google.com/r/kkleidal-pygooglevoiceupdate/.  If in the future 
the package expands to more I expect to use both as a reference.  Thank you
to the authors of both, I wouldn't have created this had I not previously used
pygooglevoice.
